    Hello! I am a creative designer from Upstate New York who is currently working in Los Angeles, California. In 2018, I graduated with a BFA in Studio Art and a BFA Art History from New York University and will have a MFA in Applied Arts from California Institute of the Arts. I work in conceptual design, and art direction. I strive to use color theory and cultural research to create pieces that feel tangible, true to their nature, and spectacular for viewers.
