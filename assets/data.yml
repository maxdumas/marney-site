  bio: >
    My adventure began in my hometown in Upstate New York but has since
    transported me to my new home in Los Angeles, California.  In 2018, I
    received my degrees of a BFA in Studio Art and a BFA Art History from New
    York University. In the upcoming year, I will have obtained a MFA in Applied
    Arts from the California Institute of the Arts. I work in conceptual design
    and art direction. I use color theory and cultural research to create pieces
    that feel tangible, true to their nature and are spectacular for viewers.
  statement: >
    Within the world of artistic design, I am driven by the concepts of beauty
    and curiosity. The standard definition society has for the idea of beauty,
    does not encompass all that I see within the potential of the concept.
    Beauty is functionality, it is detail-oriented, it is thought-provoking, it
    is an idea or feeling that remains with you after the story is over. Design
    is a fundamental component of storytelling, that allows a viewer to have a
    visceral response and sparks their curiosity about the world.  I work to be
    sure that my designs can be consumed for the individual, thus it allows one
    self-reflection through external adventures. My adventure into a design
    concept always begins with research: an investigation of art history and art
    theory for this world. Followed by exploration, with myself and others, into
    the potentials of the world. Creative, functional, and dynamic designs are
    vital in creating intriguing worlds that help effectively communicate a
    tangible narrative.
