  bio: >
    Hello! I am a creative designer from Upstate New York who is currently
    working in Los Angeles, California. In 2018, I graduated with a BFA in
    Studio Art and a BFA Art History from New York University and will have a
    MFA in Applied Arts from California Institute of the Arts. I work in
    conceptual design, and art direction. I strive to use color theory and
    cultural research to create pieces that feel tangible, true to their nature,
    and spectacular for viewers.

  statement: >
    I like to reflect on and understand that the world is full of adaptations
    that serve a purpose. Beauty and intrigue are apart of these adaptions as
    well as being their own element within the world. A character will wear a
    coat in a cold environment, a tree will grow to face the light, an office
    will be structured for productivity. It is why beautiful designs are not
    strictly beautiful in the traditional definition of the word. Rather, they
    can traditionally disturbing- disgusting even. However, they are still
    beautiful because they make sense, they can be understood to anyone no
    matter how fantastical because they understand the basic truth of the
    design. They have something about them that holds your gaze, forces you to
    stay with them, and when your eyesight finally leaves them- you remember
    them. 



    I strive to have my work stay with people not only because of intrigue, but
    because I work to be sure that it can be consumed as an individual; that it
    allows an individual self-reflection through external adventures. My
    adventure starts as I always research and investigate art history, art
    theory so that I may communicate a tangible story. Creative and dynamic
    designs are vital in creating intriguing worlds and in my work, but the
    designs have to make logical narrative sense.  It is why all I linger and
    consider all aspects and details of my designs asking if they fit the
    narrative and enhance the immersive environment, object, and or character I
    strive to create.
