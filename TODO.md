Here's what we wanna try and do:

1. Take the shader available at: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MdXyzX
2. Get it running in WebGL.
3. Make it is lightweight as possible.
4. Make it stormy and with a dark background
5. Present her logo and menu above it.
6. Fade in the stormy sea (or fade in the logo and menu!)
