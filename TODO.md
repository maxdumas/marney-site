TODO:
[x] Introduce React with Parcel.
[x] Add react routing
[x] Integrate per-page routing with the look position of the screen. Use gl-react.
[x] Create gallery pages with sample content
[x] Create simple YAML-based templating system to generate gallery content
[ ] Correctly transition the look position for the background as you navigate. This should, again, be tied to the routing.
[x] How to handle navigation between categories? Portfolio page?
[ ] Create contact page
[x] Templating engine supports markdown in the descriptions
[ ] Fill in with all real content.

- Have a splash page for each project and that can be the initial background?
